# DESCRIPTION
LogHawk is a Python-based log monitoring tool developed as part of the Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp Project. It  monitors various system logs (application, system, authorization, and access logs) for suspicious activities and potential security threats. When suspicious logs are detected, they are recorded in a comprehensive log file (comp_log.txt) for further analysis.

‚ö†Ô∏èHowever, this script is not intended to be used for Real-World Security Monitoring of Log Files. It is simply an idea of how we can Monitor Log Files. 



# FEATURES
